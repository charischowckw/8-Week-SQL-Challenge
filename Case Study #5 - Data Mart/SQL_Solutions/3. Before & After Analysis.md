# 3. Before & After Analysis
---

### 1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?

````sql
-- find out the week_number of '2020-06-15'
select
distinct week_number
from clean_weekly_sales
where week_date = '2020-06-15';

with sales_compared_4weeks as (select
*
from
(select sum(sales) as before_changed_sales from clean_weekly_sales where calendar_year = 2020 and week_number between 21 and 24) as b, 
(select sum(sales) as after_changed_sales from clean_weekly_sales where calendar_year = 2020 and week_number between 25 and 28) as a)

select
*,
after_changed_sales - before_changed_sales as net_change,
round(100 * (after_changed_sales::numeric - before_changed_sales) / before_changed_sales, 2) as perc_change
from sales_compared_4weeks;
````

#### output:

### 2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?

````sql
with sales_compared_12weeks as (select
*
from 
(select sum(sales) as before_changed_sales from clean_weekly_sales where calendar_year = 2020 and week_number between 13 and 24) as b, 
(select sum(sales) as after_changed_sales from clean_weekly_sales where calendar_year = 2020 and week_number between 25 and 36) as a)

select
*,
after_changed_sales - before_changed_sales as net_change,
round(100 * (after_changed_sales::numeric - before_changed_sales) / before_changed_sales, 2) as perc_change
from sales_compared_12weeks;
````
